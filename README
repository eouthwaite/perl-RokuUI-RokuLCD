Roku-LCD

This module supplies a small set of routines to display text on a Roku
Soundbridge whilst it is not being used for radio.

This was originally based on Tools4Roku's RokuUI module, but since it
is not available on CPAN, I have revised the RokuLCD module to use the
Roku::RCP module for inherited methods.  For more information on RokuLCD,
the documentation is encapsulated within the module and can be accessed
via a tool such as pod2html.

The M400 & M500 can't display pictures and have small screens.  If you
have a more advanced Soundbridge, I'd recommend heading over to 
http://billiatjapan.netfirms.com/Tools4Roku/ and downloading Juergen's
script.


INSTALLATION

If you have a Roku Soundbridge and wish to run all tests, set the ROKUIP
variable to the hostname or IP address of your Soundbridge prior to
installation - eg in bash:
EXPORT ROKUIP=192.168.1.86

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
